A QR code card layout built with HTML and CSS that focuses on alignment, spacing, and typography. The page centers a card both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox, creating a clean and balanced layout. Inside the card, an image displays a QR code, followed by a title and supporting text that encourage users to improve their front-end skills. Rounded corners, font styling, and color choices are used to create a modern card-style design, portraying how structure and styling work together to present content clearly and visually.
